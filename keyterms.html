        <strong>Digital Computer:</strong> Any class of devices capable of
        solving problems by processing information in discrete form. It operates
        on data, including magnitudes, letters, and symbols, that are expressed
        in binary codeâ€”i.e., using only the two digits 0 and 1.

        significant changes in the Cambridge mathematics curriculum and in the
        way mathematics was perceived in Britain throughout the nineteenth
        century.

        <strong>Analytical Engine</strong> - theoretical, general-purpose, fully
        program-controlled, automatic mechanical digital computer. It would be
        able to perform any calculation set before it. There is no evidence that
        anyone before Babbage had ever conceived of such a device, let alone
        attempted to build one.
